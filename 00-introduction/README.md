# Introduction

JavaScript is dynamically typed, interpreted programming language. Variables are untyped. It is a prototype based language and is very effective in Object Oriented and Functional Programming Styles.
Currently JavaScript is named by the release year ES2019, ES2020. Mozilla the inventor of JavaScript gave submit the standards to European Computer Manufacturer's Association ECMA, where the official names comes from. JavaScript was registered trademark of SUN who is now owned by Oracle.

JavaScripts main host environment was web browsers, since 2010 node also enabled JavaScript to be access the entire operating system. Thus made is even more popular and made it a viable backend language as well.

Currently JavaScript is one of the most used and popular language, it is the glue of browser based sites and applications, as well as one of the most popular middle tier languages.

## Browser Developer Tools Shortcut for Browsers
```command+option+I```

## Node Command Line
```
> .help
.break    Sometimes you get stuck, this gets you out
.clear    Alias for .break
.editor   Enter editor mode
.exit     Exit the repl
.help     Print this help message
.load     Load JS from a file into the REPL session
.save     Save all evaluated commands in this REPL session to a file

Press ^C to abort current expression, ^D to exit the repl”
```

You can run a JavaScript file from node by

```$ node fileName.js```

If you want to see any output when running programs in node make sure you add ```console.log()```

> Note: **REPL** stands for READ, EVAL, PRINT, LOOP is a computer environment similar to Shell (Unix/Linux) and command prompt. When Node is installed it comes with REPL.

> Note: **NPM** stands for Node Package Manager. In our projects whatever functionality we need or dependency we have, we can add a Node Package to achieve this functionality. NPM also has the capability to build our project and run certain fundamentals scripts. For example, test, lint, start/stop server, watch, build, etc.

> Note: Remember **JavaScript is case sensitive**!

> Note: **JavaScript ignore white spaces**!

There were and are still a lot of misunderstandings and opinions about this language. Labeling JavaScript as not complete or a toy language not for software engineers. This comes from the lack of the really understanding the language, its capabilities, browser implementation differences, also lack of understanding what it is build to do. Not all languages can, should do everything. Every computer language has a domain, strengths and weaknesses. The technology is just a tool, unless it is used by a craftsman, the outcome will most of the time be disappointing.

I hope you will enjoy learning JavaScript, and love the language as I do.
